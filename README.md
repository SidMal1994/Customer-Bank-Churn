1. Analyzed the features, to try to understand them, and have some insights.

2. Prepared the data for the modelling.
Applied a one-hot-encoding over the categorical features.
Spitted the data into the train and test sets
Standardizing the features on each set.

3. Using Logistic Regression (Scikit-Learn) developed the model checked the accuracy of the data.
